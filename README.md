# Project: Logistic Regression
## Defination:
Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome.The goal of logistic regression is to find the best fitting that describe the relationship between dependent variable and independent variable

So given some feature "x" it tries to find out whether some event "y" happens or not.The dependent variable is the one whose values you want to predict. The dependent variable must be binary (i:e either 0 or 1). 

logit(p) = b0 + b1X1 +b2X2 + b3X3
The logistic regression coefficients are the coefficients b0, b1, b2, b3

## Data Set:
For the project, I have used the Jury Dataset. There are three independent variables: Gender, Party, and Pah. The dependent variable is Liability which is coded 1 Yes and 0 (No).
